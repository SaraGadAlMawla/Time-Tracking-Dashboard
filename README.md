## My process

- Break down the design into possible sections
- Write down the HTML initial skeleton
- Write the CSS for the Mobile version first
- Tweak the HTML as needed
- Continue to large screens modifications
- Tweak HTML as requiered

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The versatility of FlexBox, I used it a lot in this project.
- The importance of keeping the specificity of CSS selectors in mind especially when debugging.
- I practiced some positioning while trying to get the colored backgrounds in place.
- I discovered Microsoft Power Toys, mainly the color picker there.

### Continued development

- I need to practice better positioning techniques

- Using paddings and margins in responsive design proved difficult, I want to practice
propper use of those propperties while stying responsive

- Practice better mobile first flow as I found myself overwriting a lot of what I coded
for the mobile version.

### Useful resources

- [MDN on FlexBox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - I looked at this documentation a lot when trying to figure things out.
